**ARM big.LITTLE architecture:**
	The ARM big.LITTLE architecture is a heterogeneous computing architecture developed by ARM Holdings for balancing power consumption and performance capabilities within a single processor package. 
	This innovative architecture combines high-performance cores (big cores) with highly energy-efficient cores (LITTLE cores) in a single chip. The idea is to address the diverse demands of mobile devices and embedded systems, which often need to balance between intensive processing tasks and prolonged battery life.
