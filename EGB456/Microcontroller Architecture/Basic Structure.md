#### Word
The word size of a CPU indicates how many bits can be processed simultaneously by the processor's data paths or how many bits make up a typical register size. Common word sizes include:
	- **8-bit**: Early microprocessors like the Intel 8080 and MOS Technology 6502 used 8-bit words.
	- **16-bit**: Processors like the Intel 8086 and Motorola 68000 used 16-bit words.
	- **32-bit**: Modern processors, such as those in the Intel Pentium and early ARM families, often use 32-bit words.
	- **64-bit**: Many contemporary processors, including the x86-64 architecture and modern ARM processors, use 64-bit words.
