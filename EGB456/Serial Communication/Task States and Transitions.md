#### Summary:

Tasks in FreeRTOS move between well-defined states: Running, Ready, Blocked, Suspended, and Deleted. Understanding transitions between them is key to effective task control.

### ðŸ”„ Task States and Transitions

**Slide 6â€“10 Overview:**

- **Running**: Currently executing on CPU
    
- **Ready**: Can run, waiting for CPU
    
- **Blocked**: Waiting for delay, semaphore, etc.
    
- **Suspended**: Inactive until explicitly resumed
    
- **Deleted**: Removed from scheduling (memory freed)
    

**Common Transitions:**

- Ready â†’ Running: when scheduled
    
- Running â†’ Blocked: calls delay or waits
    
- Running â†’ Suspended: via `vTaskSuspend()`
    
- Running â†’ Deleted: via `vTaskDelete()`
