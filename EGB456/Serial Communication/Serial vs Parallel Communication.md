# Serial vs Parallel Communication

- **Parallel**:  
  - Fast, simple for matched CPU/peripheral, but expensive and noisy at long range.
  - One wire per bit.
- **Serial**:  
  - Cost-effective, fewer lines (Tx, Rx, GND), needs parallel-serial conversion (shift registers).
  - Uses UART/USART.
  - Smaller connectors (USB, SATA).
