# Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication

- **Synchronous**:  
  - Shared clock for transmitter and receiver.
  - Higher throughput, more complex hardware.
- **Asynchronous**:  
  - Start/stop bits for sync, only data line needed.
  - Simpler, less throughput, more overhead.
- **Clock frequency mismatch** limits frame length in async.
