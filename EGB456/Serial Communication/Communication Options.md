# Communication Options

- **Analog**:  
  - Low-cost, but susceptible to noise.  
  - Good for high-fidelity audio/music.

- **Parallel**:  
  - High speed, not suitable for long distances due to cost, clock, noise, and sync issues.

- **Serial**:  
  - Efficient over long distances, fewer wires, includes error detection, supports topologies.

- **Networks**:  
  - Transfer packets, methods for synchronization, error detection, layered protocols.
