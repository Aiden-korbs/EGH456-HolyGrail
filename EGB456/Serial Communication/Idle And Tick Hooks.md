**Slide 11‚Äì13 Overview:**

- **Idle Hook (`vApplicationIdleHook`)**
    
    - Called when no other tasks are ready
        
    - Can enter low-power mode or run background cleanup
        
    - Must not block!
        
- **Tick Hook (`vApplicationTickHook`)**
    
    - Called every tick interrupt (based on `configTICK_RATE_HZ`)
        
    - Useful for periodic updates or system timing
        
    - Must be short and fast
