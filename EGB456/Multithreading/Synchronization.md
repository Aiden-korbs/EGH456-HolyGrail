#### Summary:

Synchronization mechanisms such as semaphores and mutexes help manage concurrent access to resources and coordinate task execution in FreeRTOS.

**Slide 47‚Äì52 Overview:**

- **Semaphores:**
    
    - Binary: 0 or 1, used for signaling or exclusive access
        
    - Counting: allow N concurrent accesses (like ticketing)
        

**Analogy:**

- Library: 5 books, first 5 people borrow one; 6th waits or returns later
