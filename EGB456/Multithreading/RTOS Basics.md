**Slide 22‚Äì26, 45‚Äì46 Overview:**

- **RTOS Services:**
    
    - Task creation and prioritization
        
    - Interrupt integration
        
    - Semaphores, queues, and synchronization
        
    - Tick-based timekeeping
        
- **FreeRTOS Features:**
    
    - Preemptive or cooperative scheduling
        
    - Small footprint, fast context switching
        
    - Modular and portable across MCU platforms
