The TM4C1294NCPDT microcontroller is integrated with the following set of on-chip [[Microcontroller Memory|memory]]
	• Non-volatile (retains data when powered down) 
		– 1024 KB Flash memory (4 x 256 KB banks) 
			• Main Program Code (instructions and data), cheaper to manufacture 
		– 6KB EEPROM 
			• Data storage 
		– Internal ROM loaded with TivaWare for C Series software: 
			• TivaWare Peripheral Driver Library 
			• TivaWare Boot Loader 
	• Volatile (data disappears when powered down) 
		– 256 KB single-cycle SRAM 
			• Very fast, higher number of write and read cycles 
			• Runtime memory for program stack, peripheral registers and runtime variables
