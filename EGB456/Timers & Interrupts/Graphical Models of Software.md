##### State Diagram:
- Useful for small sections of code, functions or subroutines
- ###### Pros of state Machines:
	- Easy to develop code for multithreaded and event driven systems
	- Cab be formally optimised
	- concurrency can be depicted using multiple machines
	- one thread could be executing while others are waiting for events
- ###### Cons of state machines:
	- Cannot describe structure of modules
	- Does not show how to break down into subroutines
	- Communications between SMs (state machines) can be difficult to depict

##### Flow Charts:
- Good for event driven, object models, language recognition
