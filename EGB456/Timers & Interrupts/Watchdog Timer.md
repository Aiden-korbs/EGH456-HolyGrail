#### Summary:
- Two timers with 32 bit down counters and programmable load registers
	- Down counters basically mean they count backwards from a maximum of: $$2^n -1$$
	- Example: $$2^{32} - 1$$
	- Prog Load Regs can be loaded with initial count value for the timer
- Has a configurable Interrupt 
	- allows the system or application designer to set up interrupts that are triggered by various conditions or events
	- with optional NonMaskable Interrupt (NMI)
		- An NMI is a special type of interrupt that cannot be ignored (masked) by the processor.
- Watchdog timers are used to regain control when system has failed
	- ie Software or external device error
- Source Clock
	- One module clocked via [[System Clock]]
	- Other is clocked using an alternate clock
		- alternate clock can be slower or derived from a different oscillator, which might be more stable or have lower power consumption.
