#### Asynchronous Events:
- Are independent of the cpu
	- External events (switch actions)
	- Events that indicate an input device has data available
	- When an output device needs data

#### Random and Periodic Events:
| Data Rate | Pattern  | Increasing Time --->        |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Low       | Random   | ⊥    ⊥  ⊥     ⊥   ⊥ ⊥   ⊥   |
|           | Periodic | ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥   |
| High      | Random   | ⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥   ⊥⊥⊥   ⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥ |
|           | Periodic | ⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥ ⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥ ⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥ ⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥  |
##### Exceptions:
- Any condition that needs to stop the normal flow of instruction execution (F-D-E)
- Categories:
	- Resets
	- System
		- NMIs
		- SysTick, Supervisor/Pendable Service Call (SVCall, PendSV)
	- Faults
		- e.g., HardFault, MemManage, BusFault
	- Interrupt (IRQ)
		- User/Device interrupts (exception)
- ###### Exceptions vs Interrupts:
	- [[Exceptions]]
		- are synchronous events generated when the processor detects any predefined condition while executing instructions
		- Types: Faults, Traps & Aborts
			- Faults are detected and serviced by processor before the faulting instructions
			- A trap is an exceptions that is reported at the instruction boundary, immediately after the instruction
	- [[Interrupts]] (subset of exceptions)
		- Are handled by the processor **after** finishing the current instruction
		- Interrupt is an asynchronous event usually generated by hardware (Ex, I/O) and is not in sync with processor instruction execution

##### Exception Handlers / Interrupt Service Routine (ISR):
- An exception handler is a software routine that is executed when a specific exception condition occurs.
- For an interrupt this is referred to as an ISR
- VTABLE holds the address of each ISR
- Most, but not all, exception handlers return to the previous code

```c
void Timer0IntHandler(void) { 
TimerIntClear(TIMER0_BASE, TIMER_TIMA_TIMEOUT); 
// Clear the timer interrupt. 
IntMasterDisable(); // Disable Interrupts 
GPIO_PORTQ_DATA_R ^= GPIO_PIN_7; //Toggle LED 
IntMasterEnable(); //Enable Interrupts
}
```
