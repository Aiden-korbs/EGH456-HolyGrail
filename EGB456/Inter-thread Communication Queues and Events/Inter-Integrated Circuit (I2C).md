# Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)

I2C, discussed in [[Inter-Thread Communication]], features:

- Multi-master, multi-slave
- Half-duplex synchronous communication
- Low speed suitable for short-distance
- Clock (SCL) and Data (SDA) lines
- Open-drain configuration

See the protocol detail: [[Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) Protocol]]
